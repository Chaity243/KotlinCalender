I have made this project to learn the practice the kotlin language for Android Development purpose by following the series of blogs and sources.

A Kotlin calendar with events and a customizable widget.

An offline calendar without any other calendar integration. You can easily create recurring events and setup reminders, it can also display week numbers.

Contains a resizable 4x4 widget where you can customize the color of the text, as well as the alpha and the color of the background.

Contains no ads or unnecessary permissions. It is fully open-source, provides customizable colors.

The Storage permission is needed only for exporting or importing events from .ics files.

The Contacts permission is used only at importing contact birthdays and anniversaries.
